# 640Project2

This is the source code for CS640 - Introduction to Computer Networking, Project 2. In this project, we use a skeleton project which defines a learning switch and router implementation. By default, the switch and router drop any packet they encounter. 

The students are responsible for defining what the switch and router do with the packets. This project is meant to be tested using the Mininet network simulator and the POX network controller.
